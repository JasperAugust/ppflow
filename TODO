# TODO 

[x] Docking working on a single pair with ADCP
[x] Docking working with all pairs
[x] Add NRP1 and RPAR pair to the receptor ligand 133 list. Is a separate list

[.] Generate new peptides for NRP1 and re-dock them and compare against RPAR, Have only optimized peptides from GRPAR
[-] Dock all of the available RPARs in the literature so we can table and decide with which to move forward with
